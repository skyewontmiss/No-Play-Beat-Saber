# No Play Beat Saber

Seriously... why would you want this?

Hello all! This is No Play Beat Saber. A mod by... Kaylerr, the first... no. The second... ...still no? 
One of the first 15 year old Quest Modders to travel the earth, but today's mod is significant in the fact that with this installed and loaded, you cannot play Beat Saber, and if you try, it crashes (totally intended)
